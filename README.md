# knights-trevails

The purpose of this project is to continue learning dynamic data structures. This project will use graphs in lieu of binary search trees or linked lists. In the end, the user should be able to enter a coordinate of the board in the function and a destination and then see how many steps it will take to get there. It should print out the total number of steps and the steps along the way. Thus should help me better understand the breadth of dynamic data structures and how they can be used within my code.
